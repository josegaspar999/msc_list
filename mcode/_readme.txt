In this folder is code to extract information from files created by hand from webpages.

See main code in "main_tst.m" (based in calling "z_complete_process.m")


-- Yet to do:

main_tst(-1) gets html data files
however one needs word to convert html to txt

after processing a new dataset,
it is important to check if nothing has been lost from the past
